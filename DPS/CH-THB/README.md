CH-THB: The Versatile Toolhead PCB

The CH-THB is a specialized PCB board designed to manage and control a single toolhead, seamlessly connecting it to the main machine control system. This board is highly versatile, supporting various toolhead types, including 3D printers, lasers, routers, and more.

  Key Features:

      Heater and High-Power Outputs:
        Two high-power outputs for heaters or PWM-controlled devices with demanding power requirements.
      Temperature Sensing:
        Two thermistor inputs for accurate real-time temperature monitoring.
      PWM Outputs:
        Two PWM outputs for controlling servos, BLTouch sensors, or cooling fans.
      Digital Interfaces:
        One digital input and one digital output for additional functionality, such as endstops or status signaling.
      Stepper Motor Control:
        A dedicated output for driving a single stepper motor, ideal for toolhead-mounted extrusion or positioning tasks.
      Streamlined Communication:
        Ensures reliable communication between the toolhead and the machine, simplifying toolhead management and enhancing modularity.
