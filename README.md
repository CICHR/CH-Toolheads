CICHR Toolheads

The changeable toolheads are designed for maximum versatility and seamless integration, communicating directly with the printer via a custom PCB. This PCB enables precise control and coordination between the tool head and the printer, ensuring fast, accurate swaps between different functions. The custom PCB features:

    2 Power Outputs: Ideal for driving heaters or other high-power devices, such as hotends or heating elements for specific tools.
    2 PWM Outputs: Control accessories like fans, BLTouch, or other adjustable components using pulse-width modulation (PWM) for fine-tuned operation.
    1 Thermistor Input: Dedicated input for temperature sensors, allowing real-time monitoring and control of heating elements or environmental conditions.
    1 Stepper Motor Output: Provides control for stepper motors, supporting direct drive extruders or motors required for other specialized tools.

This system allows you to quickly swap between different toolheads, such as 3D printing extruders, CNC milling tools, lasers, or liquid extruders, without complex rewiring, while maintaining full control over key functions.
