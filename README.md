CICHR Toolheads

The changeable toolheads are designed for maximum versatility and seamless integration, communicating directly with the printer via a custom PCB. This PCB enables precise control and coordination between the tool head and the printer, ensuring fast, accurate swaps between different functions. The custom PCB features:

Heater and High-Power Outputs:
    Two high-power outputs for heaters or PWM-controlled devices with demanding power requirements.

Temperature Sensing:
    Two thermistor inputs for accurate real-time temperature monitoring.

PWM Outputs:
    Two PWM outputs for controlling servos, BLTouch sensors, or cooling fans.

Digital Interfaces:
    One digital input and one digital output for additional functionality, such as endstops or status signaling.

Stepper Motor Control:
    A dedicated output for driving a single stepper motor, ideal for toolhead-mounted extrusion or positioning tasks.

Streamlined Communication:
    Ensures reliable communication between the toolhead and the machine, simplifying toolhead management and enhancing modularity.

This system allows you to quickly swap between different toolheads, such as 3D printing extruders, CNC milling tools, lasers, or liquid extruders, without complex rewiring, while maintaining full control over key functions.
